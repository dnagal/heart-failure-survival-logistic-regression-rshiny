## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Uploading the dataset
```{r}
hf <- read.csv("~/Desktop/heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv")
```

## Taking a quick glance at the dataset
```{r}
str(hf)
summary(hf)
```

## Boxplots of the variable "age" sorted by "death_event"
```{r}
hf %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(DEATH_EVENT), y = age)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Death Event", y = "Age")
```

## Boxplots of the variable "ejection_fraction" sorted by "death_event"
```{r}
hf %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(DEATH_EVENT), y = ejection_fraction)) +
  geom_boxplot()
#ejection fraction refers to the percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction
```

## Box Tidwell test as part of assumptions check
```{r}
#box-tidwell***
hf$DEATH_EVENT <- as.numeric(as.character(hf$DEATH_EVENT))

# Check for missing or invalid values
summary(hf$age)
summary(hf$serum_creatinine)
summary(hf$platelets)

# Drop rows with NA or <= 0 (Box-Tidwell requires positive values)
hf_bt <- hf[ hf$age > 0 & hf$serum_creatinine > 0 & hf$platelets > 0, ]

hf_bt$age_ln        <- hf_bt$age * log(hf_bt$age)
hf_bt$creatinine_ln <- hf_bt$serum_creatinine * log(hf_bt$serum_creatinine)
hf_bt$platelets_ln  <- hf_bt$platelets * log(hf_bt$platelets)

bt_model <- glm(
  hf$DEATH_EVENT ~ age + age_ln +
    serum_creatinine + creatinine_ln +
    platelets + platelets_ln,
  family = binomial(link = "logit"),
  data = hf_bt
)

print(summary(bt_model))
#The linearity of the logit was assessed using Box–Tidwell interaction terms.
#platelets and age satisfied the assumption (p > 0.05), while serum_creatinine
#violated linearity (p = 0.002), indicating a potential need for transformation
#or alternative modeling for this predictor.

#log transformation for serum creatinine 
hf_bt$log_creatinine <- log(hf_bt$serum_creatinine)

#verifying transformation 
bt_model_fixed <- glm(
  hf_bt$DEATH_EVENT ~ age + log_creatinine + platelets,
  family = binomial,
  data = hf_bt
)

print(summary(bt_model_fixed))
#All predictors now satisfy the linearity assumption 
#(Box–Tidwell no longer needed since creatinine is log-transformed)
```

## Conducting VIF as part of assumptions check
```{r}
#calculating VIF
library(car)

# fit your logistic regression model (without Box-Tidwell terms)
logit_model <- glm(
  DEATH_EVENT ~ age + serum_creatinine + platelets,
  family = binomial(link = "logit"),
  data = hf
)

# compute VIFs
vif(logit_model)
#VIF <5 for age, serum creatinine, and platelets suggesting that multicollinearity is not an issue 
```


## Using set.seed to ensure that results are reproducible every time this code is run
```{r}
set.seed(123)
```

## Installing caret to allow for createDataPartition
```{r}
library(caret)
```

## Creating a training and test split where 80% of the data will go to training and 20% is unobserved testing data
```{r}
train_index <- createDataPartition(hf$DEATH_EVENT, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
train <- hf[train_index, ]
test  <- hf[-train_index, ]
```

## Logistic regression model
```{r}
model <- glm(
  DEATH_EVENT ~ age + anaemia + creatinine_phosphokinase +
    diabetes + ejection_fraction + high_blood_pressure +
    platelets + serum_creatinine + serum_sodium +
    sex + smoking + time,
  data = train,
  family = binomial
)

summary(model)
```

## Interpreting coefficients 
```{r}
exp(cbind(
  OR = coef(model),
  confint(model)
))
```

## Making predictions
```{r}
test$prob <- predict(model, newdata = test, type = "response")
test$pred <- ifelse(test$prob > 0.5, 1, 0)
```

## Convert both prediction and actual to factors with same levels
```{r}
test$pred <- factor(test$pred, levels = c(0, 1))
test$death_event <- factor(test$DEATH_EVENT, levels = c(0, 1))
```

## Run confusion matrix using the factor columns
```{r}
confusionMatrix(test$pred, test$death_event)
```

```{r}
library(pROC)
```

## ROC curve + AUC
```{r}
roc_obj <- roc(test$death_event, test$prob)
auc(roc_obj)

plot(roc_obj)
```
